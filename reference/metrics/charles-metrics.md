## Deploy metrics

Deploy metrics is a functionality that allows a dashboard view with the necessary information for you to follow up your deployments, such as success or error occurences number and the average implementation time.

There are other available information: 

* Release name;
* The chosen circle;
* Deploy's date and duration;
* Responsible for the deploy;
* Undeploy cases;
* Modules, components and used versions;
* Deploy status: Deployed, Deploying, Error, Undeployed and Undeploying.

## Circles metrics 

It is a management feature that helps you view and follow the technical information about your circles.

The circle metrics allows you to have an overview about your circles' history with:  

* \*\*\*\*[**Active and inactive**](../circles.md#active-and-inactive-circles) circles;
* Releases for every component/module/version; 
* Circle average life time;
* Circle's creation date;
* Deploy/undeploy of the circle.
