# Properties injections

A very important operation that should be considered when preparing your application is the property injection in the manifests performed by Butler. See them below: 

* **name:**  Kubernetes’ resource name. **** Some resources managed by Charles need to have their names altered, in order to make different versions of the same application available in different circles. The property name will have the following value:  ****  **&lt;originalManifest.metadata.name&gt;-&lt;tag&gt;-&lt;deploymentId&gt;** 
* **originalManifest.metadata.name:** Name generated by the application’s chart;
* **tag:** Image’s tag;
* **deploymentId:** Deployment’s entity unique identifier created by Butler.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This update only happens in **Deployment’s** type resources.
{% endhint %}

* **namespace:** Your deployment's namespace. ****This namespace is described during the Workspace configuration and indicates which namespace the deployment will happen. If the charts insert this value in the manifests, Charles will overwrite them. ****
* **labels:** Kubernetes’ resources labels.  
  ****In order to make Butler’s reconciliation cycle and Istio’s routes created correctly work, some labels need to be available in all resources applied to the cluster. See them below:  


  * **deploymentId:** Unique identifier of the deployment's entity created by Butler; 
  * **circleId:** Unique circle's identifier where the deployment will be created. 

  
  
  ****See below an example of a generated manifest after the chart compilation:

```text
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: http-https-echo
  labels:
    component: http-https-echo
    tag: v1
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: http-https-echo
      labels:
        component: http-https-echo
        tag: v1
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: http-https-echo
          image: mendhak/http-https-echo:latest
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: http-https-echo

```

  
After the property injection, this same manifest will be:  

```text
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: http-https-echo-v1-bc0e1df9-c008-4d86-b534-d782badf3741
  namespace: example-namespace
  labels:
    component: http-https-echo
    tag: v1
    deploymentId: bc0e1df9-c008-4d86-b534-d782badf3741
    circleId: b4b62bc2-4dfd-4673-bc67-cc2cbcf9bb2f
spec:
  template:
    metadata:
      name: http-https-echo
      labels:
        component: http-https-echo
        tag: v1
        deploymentId: bc0e1df9-c008-4d86-b534-d782badf3741
        circleId: b4b62bc2-4dfd-4673-bc67-cc2cbcf9bb2f
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: http-https-echo
          image: mendhak/http-https-echo:latest
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      component: http-https-echo

```

After this configuration, you can use Charles to perform deployment in your application in segmented circles.
