# Defining a Workspace

The workspace allows you to segment CharlesCD's use in your team, defining **personalized users permissions** that will assure safety to your project.

{% hint style="info" %}
You need only one installation, and the teams will be able to use Charles with different configurations, or you may create a workspace to represent different development environments, such as staging, production, etc.
{% endhint %}

Each workspace has the following configuration:

* Access control and **user groups permissions**;
* Register on [**Docker Registry**](docker-registry.md), [**Git**](github.md) **and** [**Continuous Deployment \(CD\)**;](../../reference/cd-configuration.md)
* Customize the [**Circle Matcher**](../../reference/circle-matcher.md);
* Register your applications [**metrics provider**](../../reference/metrics/register-metrics-provider.md). 

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **root** user gives you the permission to create a workspace. However, users with **mantainer** profile are able to configure with the necessary information as well.
{% endhint %}

### How to get an identifier on my workspace?  <a id="como-obter-o-identificador-do-meu-workspace"></a>

Once your workspace is created, even without the configuration ****definitions**,** it already has a single identifier. 

To get this information, select the workspace you want and then on the left menu, click on **Copy ID.**
