# Defining a Workspace

The workspace allows you to segment CharlesCD's use in your team, defining **personalized users' permissions** that will assure safety to your project.

{% hint style="info" %}
You need only one installation, and the teams will be able to use Charles with different configurations, or you may create a workspace to represent different development environments, such as staging, production, etc.
{% endhint %}

### Workspace configuration

Each workspace has the following configurations:

* Access control and **user groups permissions**;
* **Git,** [**Docker Registry**](https://docs.charlescd.io/get-started/defining-a-workspace/docker-registry) ****and [**Continuous Deployment \(CD\)**;](https://docs.charlescd.io/reference/cd-configuration)
* [**Circle Matcher**](https://docs.charlescd.io/reference/circle-matcher);
* [**Metrics provider**](https://docs.charlescd.io/reference/metrics).

{% hint style="warning" %}
The **root** user gives you permission to create a workspace. However, users with **mantainer** profile are able to configure with the necessary information as well.
{% endhint %}

### How to get an identifier on my workspace?  <a id="como-obter-o-identificador-do-meu-workspace"></a>

Once your workspace is created, even without the configuration ****definitions**,** it already has a single identifier. 

To get this information, select the workspace you want, and then on the left menu, click on **Copy ID.**
