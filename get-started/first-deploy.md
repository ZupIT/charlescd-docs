# First Deploy

After you have created your first [**module**](creating-your-first-module.md) and registered your [**cluster crendentials**,](defining-a-workspace/configuracoes-de-deploy.md) you have finished all the steps needed to make your first deploy. Now, it is necessary to create a [**release** ](../reference/release.md)and provide it on the configured cluster.

Charles offers two alternatives to create a release: use the [**hypothesis** ](../reference/hyphotesis.md)flow chart or create it with docker images already available on your configured [**registry**.](defining-a-workspace/docker-registry.md)

Here, we will focus on the first approach with the following steps:

1. Click on **Hypothesis** in the homepage left side bar; 
2. Fill the name with the new hypothesis, on the **Create new hypothesis** field \(at the bottom of the hypothesis list\) and press Enter.
3. At the new created hypothesis board, click on **+Card** at the bottom of the **To do** list column;
4. Type the name of your new card and press Enter; 
5. Click on the card and associate it to a Module previously created. After this, a **branch with the name of the card will be created in the configured repository**; 
6. Perform your work on this branch. After finish, move the card to **Ready to Go**; 
7. Click on **Generate release candidate** at the bottom of the column **Ready to Go**;
8. Type the release name you want to create and click on **Generate**. A branch with the prefix **"release-darwin-" will be created on the module repository, after that the configured CI tool will turn off**;
9. A new card with **Building** status will show up at the **Builds** column. Wait until the status change to **Built**. 

After you have done the whole process above, your release will be ready to deploy.

Now, just follow the next steps to the [**Open Sea**](https://docs.charlescd.io/key-concepts) deploy:

1. On Charles homepage, click on **Circles**; 
2. Click on the Default circle \(it represents the open sea\) 
3. Click on **Override release** in upper right corner; 
4. Click on **Search for ready releases**;
5. Type the release name created above and click on **Deploy**.

Finally, Charles will provide the created release on cluster in the Open Sea. The deploy status will be shown and updated along the process.
