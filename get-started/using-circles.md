# Using Circles

From the moment you start to create your deploys, the next step is to [**create you first circles**](../reference/circles.md#how-to-create-circles) to make your applications segmentation better.

Follow the next steps:

{% hint style="info" %}
Before you follow the steps, make sure you have already installed and configured [**Circle Matcher**](../reference/circle-matcher.md) on your [**workspace**_**.**_](defining-a-workspace/)_\*\*\*\*_
{% endhint %}

1. \*\*\*\*[**Create your circle**](../reference/circles.md#how-to-create-circles);
2. Use circle matcher to verify if the logic rules created for the segmentation are correctly identifying the users.
3. Make your deploy on the circle created before.
